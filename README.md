# Carrot Chasing Algorithm (CCA)
One of the simplest path-following algorithm is Carrot Chasing Algorithm (CCA). CCA exploits the virtual target (VTP) and make the UAV chase this VTP by updating the 
heading angle direction $\psi$ Although the path generated is a nonlinear curve, the carrot chasing algorithm (CCA) for straight line can still be applied by simply discretizing the path into waypoints. After obtaining all the waypoints, CCA can be executed for each section of the path.
